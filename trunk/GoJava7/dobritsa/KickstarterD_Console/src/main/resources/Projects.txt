The original concept for TRUEnergy was envisioned over two years ago. After investing tens of thousands of hours and dollars, our team has brought the concept to what Malcolm Gladwell would call a "Tipping Point". With the raised capital, we will have the opportunity to order our first run of our innovative sports beverage, and deliver it to the backers.

In 2007, a few students at North Eugene High School in Eugene, Oregon asked their teacher to teach them how to play the ukulele. Today those students have graduated and moved on, but what they started still remains. Now nearly nine years later, the North Eugene Ukulele Allstars are ready to throw it down with their second album: Ukeing It Old-School!

The birth canal- I recorded this album in fits and spurts the last handful of years in places I’ve lived, with the bulk of stuff happening in Minnesota and Alaska when I wasn't on tour. The album was mixed at Old Blackberry Way, mastered at Magneto Mastering, and the vinyl lacquers cut at Chicago Mastering.
